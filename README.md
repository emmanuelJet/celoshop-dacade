CeloShop is a mini e-commerce testnet decentralization application(dApp) built on Ethereum Blockchain with Celo Technologies. It makes use of three smart contracts (Seller, Courier, and Buyer SmartContract) to deliver a dApp that is simpler to understand, utilize, and maintain, more resilient and performant, and easier to collaborate on

### Key Features

* **SellerContract** is where the majority of the dApp functionality resides. It has the CeloUSDToken interface that performs transactions based functions on the SellerContract and BuyerContract. It also enables buyers to add products, send products to the Courier service, and maintain added products. Lastly, its allows products buyers send product price to sellers upon successful delivery.

* **CourierContract** is where the Courier service actions happen. It has restrictions meant just for the Courier representative. It accepts items from sellers and allows item buyers to check delivery status and location from the BuyerContract. Its modifier allows just the Courier representative to perform logistics functions such as changing items location and delivering items.

* **BuyerContract** is where all buyer functions reside. It enables buyers to deposit the price of the intended purchase item to the SellerContract and sends the item price to the Seller only when a purchased item has been confirmed and received by the Buyer. It also has functions that allow buyers to check their purchase and logistics status.
